the tree satisfying all FOL* constraints, but it is not a full tree.
Let's argument the previous requirement to define a full tree.
every node is either a leaf ï¼ˆwhose height is the the maximum  among all nodes) or has two children

Action: Uncomment the commented out line in the previous constraint as well as the following two lines. 
Run this python file

# print("A full tree of height at least 3")
# solve(exists(Node, lambda n: n >= Int(3)))

take a look before the lab.
